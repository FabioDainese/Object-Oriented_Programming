# Introduction
A funny group project with the aim of creating a *Java* application in order to familiarize and to put into practice some **design patterns** (*Factory, Singleton, Prototype, Adapter, Composite, Decorator, Flyweight, Command, Iterator, Observer, State, Strategy, Visitor, Memento*).

All the material was developed for the '*Object-Oriented Programming*' [Ca' Foscari University](https://www.unive.it) bachelor's degree course in '*Technologies and Information Science*' (2016/2017).

# Project Description
The idea behind this project was to developed a *simpler* version of the [**Magic: The Gathering**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering) card table game. 
With '*simpler*' version we mean that there's only few cards available, 25 uniqie cards to choose from, over the thousands that the actual game offers. Another simplification was made by removing some *gameplay* phases/settings.

Once you'll start the game there will be an inithial setup phase, where the *two* players can choose the cards that will compose their decks if they want it or just leave it up to the game to pick them. After that it will start the actual *gameplay* battle.

The *game* was designed to be played as a textual version using the console (*STDIN,STDOUT*).

### Cards
The cards made available to the players are: **Abduction**, **Aether Barrier**, **Aether Flash**, **Afflict**, **Aggressive Urge**, **Ancestral Mask**, **Argothian Enchantress**, **Aura Blast**, **Benevolent Ancestor**, **Boiling Earth**, **Bronze Sable**, **Calming Verse**, **Cancel**, **Darkness**, **Day Of Judgment**, **Deflection**, **False Peace**, **Fatigue**, **Friendly Environment**, **Homeopathy**, **Norwood Ranger**, **Reflexologist**, **Savor The Moment**, **Volcanic Hammer** , **World At War**.

**N.B.** This project was developed using the *NetBeans IDE*, so all the additional files that you'll find are useful to run it through that platform by simply importing all the project, but if you want to access/read the actual *Java* game files you can find them at the following path [`'Project/src/cardgame/'`](Project/src/cardgame/).
